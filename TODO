1. i want to implement this functionality on my remote.rohan-dhanawade.de webpage "Workshop Pace", where there are three buttons : Too slow, Just right, Too Fast.
2. Add a good icon to the .exe file and when the app is running and sitting in tray
3. in the frontend webpage, Add a feedback section, where users can give stars out of 5. and also a textbox saying "any suggestions or feedback?" 
4. In Firebase, delete the reactions data after few days, but only keep the feedback ratings, and any feedback texts which are visible to me when i press ctrl+shift+L, somewhere below the current leave room and stuff, add the Feedbacks link, so when i click on it a new overlay appears with average feedback ratings and scrollable feedback texts, also option to go to previous screen and a button to close the overlay.
Add a functionality, like suppose i am using two screens, and i have extended the displays, so when i run the app the overlays and dilaog boxes should appear only on the primary screen, and only the reactions should appear on both the screens. so when i press ctrl+shift+L, the overlay of rooms, feedback etc everything should appear only on the primary screen
